# vue-state-modules
- vuex like `state store` for vue but its fully made in `typescript` and `class based`.
- its a lot more flexable than vuex, you can just use it like a normal class module and it just makes your variables(states) `reactive` automatically.
- it has functions like `$watch`, `$on`, `$off`, `$emit`, `$sample` and `$revert` too.
- and you can `inspect` your `state modules` in `vue devtool`.
