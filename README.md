# vue-state-modules
- class based `state store` fully made in `typescript` for vue.
- you can just use it like a normal class instance and it just makes your variables(states) `reactive` automatically.
- it has functions like (`$watch`, `$on`, `$off`, `$emit`, `$sample` and `$revert`...) too.
- and you can `inspect` your `state modules` in `vue devtool`.
