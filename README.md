# vue-state-modules
vuex like `state store` for vue but its fully made in `typescript` and `class based`.
its a lot more flexable than vuex, you can just use it like a normal class module and it just makes your variables(states) `reactive` automatically
it has functions like `$watch`, `$commit` and `$revert` too
and you can inpect your state modules in `vue devtool`
